🚀 My C Programming Learning Journey
Welcome to my C programming repository! 🎉 This is where I document my growth and progress as I dive deeper into C programming. It’s a collection of programs, projects, and experiments I’ve created while exploring the foundational concepts and advanced techniques of this powerful language.

🗂️ Repository Overview
This repository contains various C program files organized by topics or projects. Each file demonstrates a concept, algorithm, or project I worked on while learning. It serves as both a personal reference and a resource for anyone interested in learning C.

📚 Topics Covered
Here’s a glance at what you’ll find in this repository:

Basic Syntax and Fundamentals: Hello World, variables, data types, operators, and control structures.
Functions and Recursion: Modular programming and solving problems recursively.
Pointers and Memory Management: Mastering pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and debugging memory-related issues.
Arrays and Strings: Manipulating collections of data and mastering string operations.
File Handling: Reading and writing files in C.
Data Structures: Implementations of stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and more.
Problem Solving: Solutions to coding challenges and puzzles.
Mini-Projects: Small applications and games like Tic Tac Toe to apply the learned concepts.

✨ Why C?
C is the foundation of many modern programming languages and is crucial for understanding low-level concepts like memory management, pointers, and system-level programming. Through this journey, I aim to solidify my coding fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
